# This KiBot script generates common documentation files for a two layer board design,
# including PDF schematics, PDF front and back board images, an interactive HTML BOM,
# JPEG renders of the PCB, and a STEP 3D model. Note that the STEP 3D model generation
# will throw a ton of warnings and errors but does actually work.
